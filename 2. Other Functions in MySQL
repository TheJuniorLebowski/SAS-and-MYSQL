     B)  CURDATE() Returns the current date
     C)  CURTIME() Returns the current time
     D)  DATE() Extracts the date part of a date or date/time expression
     E)  EXTRACT() Returns a single part of a date/time

     E)  DATE_SUB() Subtracts a specified time interval from a date
     F)  DATEDIFF() Returns the number of days between two dates

 3) EXTRACT function:EXTRACT() function is used to return a single part of a date/time, such as year, month, day, hour, minute, etc.
      EXTRACT(unit FROM date)   #General syntax, where unit could be month, year, day, hour, minute etc    

     A) SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM OrderDate) AS OrderYear,   # Extract Year as Order Year, Month as OrderMonth, Day as OrderDay
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM OrderDate) AS OrderMonth,        # from Orders table where OrderId is 1.
        EXTRACT(DAY FROM OrderDate) AS OrderDay,
        FROM Orders
        WHERE OrderId=1

 
 4) DATE_ADD function: The DATE_ADD() function adds a specified time interval to a date.
     
     SELECT OrderId,DATE_ADD(OrderDate,INTERVAL 45 DAY) AS OrderPayDate FROM Orders  # In this syntax, we add 45 days in
                                                                                      # in OrderDate and pull it as OrderPayDate

     SELECT OrderId,DATE_SUB(OrderDate,INTERVAL 2 MONTH) AS SubtractDate FROM Orders  # Here we subtract 2 months from OrderDate
                                                                                      # and pull it as SubtractDate

       

   6) SQL Scalar Functions: SQL scalar functions return a single value, based on the input value.
        UCASE() - Converts a field to upper case
        LCASE() - Converts a field to lower case
        MID() - Extract characters from a text field
        LEN() - Returns the length of a text field
        ROUND() - Rounds a numeric field to the number of decimals specified
        NOW() - Returns the current system date and time
        FORMAT() - Formats how a field is to be displayed



  9) MID function: The MID() function is used to extract characters from a text field.
         SELECT MID(column_name,start[,length]) FROM table_name     # General syntax

        SELECT MID(City,1,4) as SmallCity FROM Persons  #This will select 1st 4 letters from City and term them as SmallCity




18) INSERT INTO: It is used for creating back up copies of files
     insert INTO new_table select * FROM existing table 
 
      A) CREATE TABLE actor_kek LIKE actor;   #Here we create a new empty table actor_kek similar as actor
         INSERT INTO actor_kek select * FROM actor;  #Then we copy value of actor table into the actor_kek
       
      B) INSERT INTO LastName,Firstname INTO actor_kek FROM actor WHERE City='Sandnes' # Using INSERT INTO with WHERE clause


13) INSERT INTO    # Used for inserting new records into a table
   #INSERT INTO statement can be written into two forms. The first form doesn't specify the column names where the data will
   # be inserted, only their values. The second form specifies both the column names and the values to be inserted.
      1)  INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...)
      2)  INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3,...) VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...)

      A) INSERT INTO Persons VALUES (4,'Nilsen', 'Johan', 'Bakken', 'Stavanger')             #This will add info into 1st 5 columns
      B) INSERT INTO Persons (P_Id, LastName, FirstName) VALUES (5, 'Tjessem', 'Jakob')      #insert data into specified columns


14) UPDATE function.   # It can be used to update/edit an existing row in a table
      A) UPDATE Persons SET Address='Nissestien 67', City='Sandnes' WHERE LastName='Tjessem' AND FirstName='Jakob'
       #IT will update Address & City column in Persons table where Lastname is Tjessam and FIrstName is Jakob
       #If we had not mentioned WHERE arg, it would have updated all the rows in the Address and CIty columns


15)  DELETE function   #Delete rows in a table
     A) DELETE FROM Persons WHERE LastName='Tjessem' AND FirstName='Jakob'  #It will delete all such conditional rows
     B) DELETE * FROM table_name    #It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table itself
